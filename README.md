** Fraud Detection Model for Credit Card Transactions **

### Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. 
The goal is to predict the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent or legitimate, 
thereby reducing financial losses due to fraud and improving overall transaction security.

### Motivation
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and individuals alike, 
resulting in substantial financial losses annually. Traditional rule-based systems often struggle to keep pace with the evolving nature of fraud patterns. 
This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a robust fraud detection model, 
enabling more accurate and efficient identification of fraudulent transactions.

 ### Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a credit card transaction being fraudulent or legitimate
- Improve the accuracy of fraud detection compared to traditional rule-based systems
- Reduce financial losses due to fraud and enhance overall transaction security
